# 🎨 OpenCV Interactive Projects

This repository contains two interactive Python projects built using OpenCV and NumPy.
Both projects are designed for educational purposes and demonstrate how to use OpenCV for real-time image manipulation and drawing operations.

# 📌 Project 1: RGB Color Controller with Trackbars
# 📖 Description

This project is an interactive RGB color controller created using OpenCV trackbars.
Users can dynamically adjust Red, Green, and Blue values using sliders and instantly see the result displayed on a canvas.
A switch button allows the user to turn the color display ON or OFF.

The project also includes:

Keyboard controls  
Reset functionality  
Color saving feature  
Real-time UI text overlay  

This project is useful for learning:

OpenCV GUI elements  
Trackbar usage  
Image color manipulation  
Real-time updates  

# ✨ Features

RGB color control using trackbars  
ON / OFF switch  
Real-time display  
Keyboard shortcuts  
Save selected colors to a file  
Reset colors  
Text overlay for UI  

# 🛠 Technologies

Python 3  
OpenCV  
NumPy  

# ▶ How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
pip install opencv-python numpy  

2. Run the script  
python rgb_color_controller.py  

# 🎮 Controls

Trackbars → Change RGB values  
Switch → Turn color ON or OFF  
Q → Quit  
R → Reset RGB values  
S → Save current color  

# 🚀 Future Improvements

HSV color mode  
Mouse color picker  
Save color as image  
GUI version using PyQt  
Preset color buttons  

# 🖌 Project 2: OpenCV Shape Drawing Demo
# 📖 Description

This project demonstrates how to draw basic geometric shapes using OpenCV:

Line  
Rectangle  
Circle  

It extends basic drawing operations into an interactive application where users can:

Change shape colors  
Move shapes using keyboard  
Clear the canvas  
Display information on screen  

This project helps beginners understand:

OpenCV drawing functions  
Canvas creation with NumPy  
Keyboard event handling  
Coordinate-based drawing  

# ✨ Features

Draw line, rectangle, and circle  
Change colors dynamically  
Move shapes using arrow keys  
Clear canvas  
On-screen instructions  
Interactive loop  

# 🛠 Technologies

Python 3  
OpenCV  
NumPy  

# ▶ How to Run
1. Install dependencies  
pip install opencv-python numpy  

2. Run the script  
python drawing_demo.py  

# 🎮 Controls

L → Change line color  
R → Change rectangle color  
C → Change circle color  
Arrow keys → Move the line  
X → Clear canvas
